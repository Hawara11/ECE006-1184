        <h1>Applications of Artificial Intelligience</h1>
            <p>AI has been dominant in various fields such as:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><span>Intelligent Robots</span> −Robots are capable of performing the tasks a person has provided. They have sensors to detect real-world physical data such as light , heat, temperature, motion, sound, bump and pressure. To exhibit intelligence they have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory. They are also able to learn from their mistakes, and can adapt to the new environment.</li>
                <br>
                   <li><span>Gaming</span> −AI plays a crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where the machine can think of a large number of possible heuristic knowledge based positions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Handwriting Recognition </span>− The recognition software for handwriting reads the text written by a pen on paper or through a stylus on screen. It is able to recognize the letter shapes and convert them into editable text.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Natural Language Processing </span> −The computer that understands the natural language spoken by humans will communicate.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Speech Recognition </span> −Some intelligent systems, while a human speaks to it, are able to hear and understand the language in terms of sentences and their meanings. It can handle various accents, slang words, background noise, change in human noise due to cold, and so on. </li>
                       <br>
                      <li><span>Vision Systems</span> −These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. For example:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist. </li>

                   <li> Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.</li>

                   <li>A spying aeroplane takes photographs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas. </li>
                   </ul>
                   </li>
                   <li><span>Expert Systems</span> −Some applications integrate machine, software, and special information to provide reasoning and advice. They give the users explanation and advice.</li>
