           <h2>Goals of Artificial Intelligience:</h2>
          <ol>
              <li><span>Build Expert Systems</span> − Systems that show smart behaviour, understand, illustrate, explain, and inform its users.</li>
                <br>
              <li><span>Applying human intelligence in machines</span> − Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>What Contributes to AI?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a science and technology based on such disciplines as computer science , biology, psychology , linguistics, math, engineering, etc. A major thrust of AI is the development of human intelligence related machine functions such as reasoning, understanding, and problem-solving.<br> Out of the following areas, one or multiple areas can contribute to build an intelligent system. </p>

           <h2>What is Artificial Intelligience Technique?</h2>
        <p> In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcomed properties:  </p>
                 <ul>
                <li>It keeps changing constantly.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Its volume is huge, next to unimaginable.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It is not well-organized or well-formatted.</li>
            </ul>
       <p> AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate..</li>
                <br>
                <li>It should be perceivable by the people who provide it.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It should be easily modifiable to correct errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI techniques elevate the speed of execution of the complex program it is equipped with.</p>
