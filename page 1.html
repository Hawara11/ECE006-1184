            <p>Technology is rising quite rapidly in today's world and we are getting in touch with different new innovations day by day. <br> One of the booming computer science developments here is Artificial Intelligence which is prepared to create a new revolution in the world by making smart machines. The Artificial Intelligence is circling us now. Currently it deals with a range of subfields, ranging from general to particular, including self-driving vehicles, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music, painting etc.<br>AI is one of Computer Scienceâ€™s fascinating and universal fields which will have a great future reach. AI is going to allow a computer to act as a human being.<br> Artificial Intelligence consists of two terms Artificial and Intelligence, in which Artificial defines "man-made" and Intelligence defines "thinking power," While AI implies "man-made thought power." <br> Thus, we may describe AI as:<br>Artificial intelligence occurs when a computer may acquire human skills such as understanding, reasoning , and problem solving You don't need to pre-program a computer with Artificial Intelligence to do any research, given the fact that you can build a computer with programmed algorithms that can research with your own intelligence, and that's the awesomeness of AI.<br>It is believed that AI is not a new technology, and some people says that as per Greek myth, there were Mechanical men in early days which can work and behave like humans. </p>
